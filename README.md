# AutoGP

My project for the annual "Jugend Forscht" competition written in JavaFX. 
Automatically generates a simple architectural ground plans based on user input. 
Also allows the user to edit the generated suggestions and adjust them to their preferences.

For more information, take a look at the odt file "schriftliche ausarbeitung jufo", which explains everything
down to the mechanics used to generate the ground plans in more detail.
